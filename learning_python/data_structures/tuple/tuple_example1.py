#Tuple: type of data structure, where we can store a multiple peices of information
#difference from list is it can't be changed , altered (is immutable)etc
#most common example is co-ordinates
#tuples are fixed , cant be updated; have indexing starting from 0

coordinates= (4,5)
cordin2= [(4,5),(8,6),(2,0),(5,9),(3,7)] #so its basically a list with so many tuples which are fixed and can not be changed
print(coordinates[1])
