#Creating our own modules and packages

* modules are just .py scripts that we call in another .py script.
* packages are a collection of modules.

**There is a \_\_init\_\_.py script that needs to be placed inside a folder so that python know that this collection of .py scripts needs to be treated as an entire package.**

* Whenever we need to use a file as package we must have \_\_init\_\_.py script inside the folder. This is a empty file.
