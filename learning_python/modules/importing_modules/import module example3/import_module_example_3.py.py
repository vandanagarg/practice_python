#Classes and Objects

#can help to make programm more organised and powerful
#what bsically classes and objects helps is in creating our own datatypes

#object is  just an instance of class (like an actual studen with some information); a class is an overall template

from student import Student
#from module import function name/class name

student1 = Student("Jim", "Business", 3.1, False)
print(student1.name)
