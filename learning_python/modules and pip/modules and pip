#Modules and  PIP
#modules are essentially a python file that we can import in our current python file in order to use code/functions written inside that file
#https://docs.python.org/3/py-modindex.html

import useful_tools  #trying to import a different python file/module 

print(useful_tools.roll_dice(10))

#some modules are built-in modules in python and some are present inside (Lib)Library folder
#usefull 3rd party python modules- so what if we want to use any module that is written by some other 3rd person and we need to use that
#for that we must first install it
#for ex; lets take python-docx , it basically helps us converting python file data in a word file, arrange and put data in word doc

#python-docx may be installed with pip if you have it available:
#pip install python-docx

#pip basically is a programm and it comes pre-installed in python version 3
#its basically used to install python modules
#its refered to as a pacakge manager, PM is something that basically helps us to install , manage, update nd uninstall different python modules

#first we need to check if PIP is intalled in our system or not
#open cmd prompt and type pip --version
#it shows which version of pip we have thus now we have one thing , moving to next (use command cls to clear everthing from cmd screen)

#now move next to install a python module and we need to use the below command in cmd to install the module
#pip install python-docx  # assuming we are installing python-docx external module
#once its done we get this below log

#log
#C:\Users\as>pip install python-docx
