#Lists ,we have to use [] these brackets to store a bunch of values and thus we create a list of some related data that we wish to have
#We can put anything in a list i.e: a number, boolean or a string #list is mutable

freinds = [ "Peeyush Singla", "My motu", "Nonu baby", "Babu"]
print (freinds) # o/p is as list  # ['Peeyush Singla', 'My motu', 'Nonu baby', 'Babu']
print("My freinds are: " + str(freinds))  # it prints the whole list # o/p as string : My freinds are: ['Peeyush Singla', 'My motu', 'Nonu baby', 'Babu']

# to print a particular value we have to do that by identifying it from their index(starts from 0)
print(freinds[0])  # prints first value
print(freinds[-2])  # prints second value from the last (so basically negative index is the values from last and it starts from -1 itself)

# to grab a selective inputs #1. lets say from 2nd till last we want to o/p  2. we want to select 2nd and 3rd value
print(freinds[1:])  # from 2nd value till end
print(freinds[1:3])  # it will print from index value 1 to 2 and will not inclue 3 , thus will just output 2nd nd 3rd value

#to modify any value at a specific location # lets say at 2nd value i want to change from My motu to husband
freinds[1] = "Husband"
print(freinds[1])

#to remove elements #use remove function and pass the value u wish to remove
